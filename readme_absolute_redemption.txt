1. Why/description
This is a full port/conversion of Absolute Redemption (Half-Life mod) to sven coop and
its sequel: Drug Barons.  
Around 2018 i ported some of the maps but the result was bad (this needed merging badly)
so i removed them from the server. Now, i thought about giving it a new try and this
is the result.
You are free to report bugs or suggest changes if you want but bear in mind i am using 
months of my free time to do this as a hobby and for the challenge, not to satisfy the 
whims of users and server owners. Please avoid making reports based only on a bspguy 
report, make sure there is a REAL problem.

2. Important notes 
rede0 is the first map for the Absolute Redemption campaign. You can pick rede1
if you want to avoid the long intro.
rede_db1 is the first map for Absolute Redemtion: Drug Barons

4. Known issues 
Cinematics may work wrong in rede6. I am not sure is this still happens.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Quality standars

I try to have the maps series without bugs and i have been maintaining and improving 
them in the last 6 years but is no easy task. Unlike other people i do not have
a public server or a team to make a test so i have to do that alone. this mean that 
i may miss problems that can only be seen when 2 or more players play the maps, now i
added bots in my tests and i hope to improve the results. Worth saying that most of the
ports i played (before 2019) had serious bugs and no one cares about it.

6. Bug reporting

It would help me if you find a problem and you report it to me but please check you
are reporting a REAL problem. I have been active on scmapdb and discord for long time,
i will read messages sent to me but i may not answer because i am tired of the bad side
of the community. Avoid making reports based only on resguy/w00tguy repacker script.
I check it frequently enough so i am sure the bug reports generated by these tools will
not be a problem. I notice some people are making this kind of reports without caring 
about real issues and i am starting to believe they are just trolling.

7. Download site

For now i am using scmapdb.com to store my Sven Co-op maps/ports. This site has has been 
going downhill in the last years and is not a safe place for mappers to upload their 
maps since there are clear signs that the administrators may attempt to force random 
modifications over the maps hidden under the questionable "fixed" tag. Sadly this site 
has no alternative but i will try to find one.

8. Survival
